You will be provided with a tarred, zipped LaTeX package containing 
17 files.

Basic Style File: ametsoc.cls. 

The file ametsoc.cls is the manuscript style file.  

Use \documentclass{ametsoc} for your .tex document to
generate a PDF that follows all AMS guidelines for submission and peer review.  

Use \documentclass[twocol]{ametsoc} for your .tex document
to generate a PDF that closely
follows the layout of an AMS journal page, including single spacing and two
columns.  This journal style PDF is only for the author's personal use, and
any papers submitted in this style will not be accepted.  

Always use \documentclass{ametsoc} 
when generating a PDF for submission to the AMS. 

==================================

The file provides a basic blank template with some
section headings for authors to more easily enter their manuscript.
