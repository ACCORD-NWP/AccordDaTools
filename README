"""
This package is a "pure python" re-implementation of   an 
existing tool ( tuneBR ) which has been already developed 
by the RC-LACE colleagues Benedikt Strajnar &  Gergely Boloni 
( shared on RC-LACE forum 12/2010 )
It was a mixed of bash/fortran code which is "translated" to 
python classes (OOP approach)

It's an  "easy and quick" application of a' posteriori diagnosis
and tuning for B and R variances and based on the method of
"covariance of residuals in observation space

proposed by Desroziers et al (2005), see below:

GENERAL INFO :
MODULE NAME         : tuneBR 
USED LANGUAGE       : fortran/python 
NEEDS INSTALLATION  : NO 
NEEDS COMPILATION   : YES 
DEPENDECIES         : gfortran 
                    : python3.8.x or HIGHER
                      

HOW IT RUNS  ( ON ATOS )  ? 
----------------------------

module load python3/3.8.8-01

STEP1 : COMPILE THE FORTRAN ROUTINE  ./src/readgsa.F90 
        python3  compile.py  
        IT CREATES A PYTHON EXTENSION "readgsa.so"  UNDER ./modules 

SETP2 : PREPARE SOME ODB FILES ( CCMA FROM MINIMISATION )
        (IN THE DOCUMENTATION, A PERIOD OF 10 DAYS SHOULD BE ENOUGH )

STEP3 : GENERATE A MANDALAY BINARY WITH THE FOLLOWING sql REQUEST 
        "CREATE VIEW mandalay AS
        SELECT  obstype,varno,an_depar,fg_depar,final_obs_error FROM hdr, body, errstat"       
 

STEP3 : CONFIGURE THE "config.ini"  FILE ACCORDING TO YOUR PATHS AND ENVIRONMENT  


STEP4 : RUN 
        python3    tuneBR.py  


THE SIGMA_B ,SIGMA_O RATIOS ,AVERAGE RATIOS AND 
THE NUMBER OF USED OBSERVATIONS WILL BE PRINTED ON THE SCREEN
