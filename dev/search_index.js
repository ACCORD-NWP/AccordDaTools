At the same time, the technical and scientific knowledge about various components of this data assimilation is not so widely spread and a joint effort is needed forthe validation of these locally installed system. One of the important components of the HARMONIE data assimilation is the background error statistics. A tool for diagnostics of the background error statistics directly from the background error statistics files has therefore been developed and applied to the recently developed statistics files for HARMONIE at mesoscale (AROME)resolution (2.5 km grid resolution) at SMHI, met.no, FMI, DMI, KNMI and AEMET. This note describes the diagnostic tool (jbdiagnose) and presents results from a comparison of the different statistics from the AROME implementations.

Standard deviations for the other control variables are shown and discussed below together with the discussion of the balance operators. The most striking feature of the vorticity standard deviations is the significant increase of the values from the 5 kmdomain to the 2.5 km domains. As will be discussed in connection with the horizontal spectral covariance densities, this can partly be understood from the fact that the vorticity is a linear combination of horizontal partial derivatives of the wind field components. (A horizontal partial derivative in spectral space is essentially a multiplication with the horizontal wave-number, thus a partial derivative means a stronger amplification for smaller scale waves.) Comparing with (what we mainly are used to) standard deviations for vorticity at 15-20 km scale with the NMC method, we may also notice a shift toward lower levels for the maximum of the standard deviations. This may just be a signature of the dominance of smaller scales at lower vertical levels. However, it needs also to be understood whether the perturbation techniques applied to obtain the statistics can have any effects in this connection.","category":"page"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/#4.2-Horizontal-spectral-densities","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"4.2 Horizontal spectral densities","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"Jb diagnose","text":"Horizontal spectral covariance densities are simply extractedfrom the diagonal of the univariate vertical covariance matrices available for each horizontal wave-number on the input files. Plots for these spectral densities are presented in Figure 2 for the variables vorticity, unbalanced divergence, unbalanced temperature and unbalanced humidity at model level 46 (SE, NO, NL and ES 60 level data) or model level 44 (DK and FI 65 level data). Included in the figure are graphs for the SMHI ALARO 5 km structure functions (SE5) and the 6 different AROME domains SEarome, NLarome, NOarome, FIarome, DKarome and ESarome. Since the wind field is represented by vorticity and divergencethere is a clear shift in the maxima of the spectral densities toward smaller scales. To convert these spectral densities to kinetic energy spectra, for example, one would need to divideby (kstar)^2 where kstar is the total wave-number (kstar ≈ √k^2 +l^2 , where k and l are the horizontal wave-numbers in 2 dimensions). The spectral densities for SE5 and all the arome domains appear to be OK with one exception, the spectral densities for NOarome are significantly smaller than for the other domains (indicating much smaller perturbations in the inputdata sets) and the spectrum for the NOarome humidities appears to be corrupt.","category":"page"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/#4.3-Vertical-correlations","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"4.3 Vertical correlations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"Jb diagnose","text":"Vertical correlations are calculated by extraction of vertical covariances from vertical covariance matrices and by averaging over the horizontal wave-numbers.

These vertical correlation look completely reasonable with a tightening of the vertical correlations for the AROME domains with smaller horizontal scales as compared to the 5 km SMHI domain (true at least for vorticity and divergence). It is also interesting to note the broader vertical correlations for un-balanced temperature in the ESarome domain.

The verticalprofiles of divergence variance are rather similar for the different AROME domains. Figure 5 shows directly the percentage of divergence variance explained by vorticity as vertical profiles and Figure 6 the horizontal scale variation of the same percentage of divergence variance explanation.

With regard to the standard deviations, again the standard deviations for the NOarome domain are significantly smaller than for the other domains and it was not meaningful to plot the percentages of explained variances for this domain. With regard to the other domains, the standard deviations for the ESarome domainare larger than for the other domains, most likely because the warmer temperatures over the ESarome domain also mean more moisture. With regard to the percentage of explained variance, the explanantion by vorticity (linearized balanced geopotential) is most dominant for low vertical levels and large horizontal scales. This is also observed for synoptic scale background error statistics and is generally explained by moistening due to frictional inflow in low pressure developments. The percentage of humidity variance explained by un-balanced temperature provides a mixed picture. The vertical variations of the humidity variance explained by un-balanced temperature are quite similar for the SE5, SEarome and DKarome domains, with a strong mid-tropospheric and small horizontal scale coupling between humidity and un-balanced temperature. This can be interpreted as a signature of condensation coupled to latent heating. For the NLarome, FIarome and ESarome domains this coupling appears at much lower vertical levels, possibly indicating a stronger dominance of boundary layer and surfaceflux processes. We can not exclude that what we have seen with regard to moisturebalances could also partly reflect the erroneous use of virtual temperature instead of temperature in the generation of the background error statistics.","category":"page"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/#5-Concluding-remarks","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"5 Concluding remarks","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"Jb diagnose","text":"A tool for diagnosis of background error statistics directly from the background error statistics used in the assimilation has been developed.

Balance operators including humidity may have been influenced by an erroneous use of virtual temperature instead of temperature in the estimation of the background error statistics. This generation of background error statistics should be corrected and this comparison be repeated. Another issue to pay attention to is of course also the perturbation technique that we use to derive the background error statistics with.","category":"page"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/#Figure-7:-Standard-deviations-of-total-temperature,-temperature-explained-by-vorticity,-temperature-explained-by-un-balanced-divergence-and-un-balancedtemperature-as-function-of-vertical-level-for-the-SMHI-5-km-domain-and-for-the-six-AROME-domains.","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"Figure 7: Standard deviations of total temperature, temperature explained by vorticity, temperature explained by un-balanced divergence and un-balancedtemperature as function of vertical level for the SMHI 5 km domain and for the six AROME domains.","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/#Figure-8:-Vertical-variation-of-the-percentage-of-temperature-variance-explained-by-vorticity-and-unbalanced-divergence-for-the-SMHI-5-km-domain-and-the-six-AROME-domains.","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"Figure 8: Vertical variation of the percentage of temperature variance explained by vorticity and unbalanced divergence for the SMHI 5 km domain and the six AROME domains.","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/#Figure-9:-Horizontal-scale-variation-of-the-percentage-of-temperature-variance-explained-by-vorticity-and-un-balanced-divergence-for-the-SMHI-5-km-domainand-the-six-AROME-domains.","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"Figure 9: Horizontal scale variation of the percentage of temperature variance explained by vorticity and un-balanced divergence for the SMHI 5 km domainand the six AROME domains.","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/#Figure-10:-Standard-deviations-of-total-specific-humidity,-specific-humidity-explained-by-vorticity,-specific-humidity-explained-by-un-balanced-divergence-and-un-balanced-specific-humidity-as-function-of-vertical-level-for-the-SMHI-5-km-domain-and-for-the-six-AROME-domains.","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"Figure 10: Standard deviations of total specific humidity, specific humidity explained by vorticity, specific humidity explained by un-balanced divergence and un-balanced specific humidity as function of vertical level for the SMHI 5 km domain and for the six AROME domains.","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/#Figure-11:-Vertical-variation-of-the-percentage-of-specific-humidity-variance-explained-by-vorticity,-un-balanced-divergence-and-un-balanced-temperature-and-surface-pressure-for-the-SMHI-5-km-domain-and-five-AROME-domains.","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"Figure 11: Vertical variation of the percentage of specific humidity variance explained by vorticity, un-balanced divergence and un-balanced temperature and surface pressure for the SMHI 5 km domain and five AROME domains.","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"jbdiagnose/#Figure-12:-Horizontal-scale-variation-of-the-percentage-of-specific-humidity-variance-explained-by-vorticity,-un-balanced-divergence-and-un-balanced-temperature-and-surface-pressure-for-the-SMHI-5-km-domain-and-five-AROME-domains.","page":"Jb diagnose","title":"Figure 12: Horizontal scale variation of the percentage of specific humidity variance explained by vorticity, un-balanced divergence and un-balanced temperature and surface pressure for the SMHI 5 km domain and five AROME domains.","text":"","category":"section"}]
